# No rm, no archive folders, use .old suffix

Rating cleanup is forward-only.

Do not run `rm database/migrations/*.php` and do not move migrations into `database/migrations_archive/`.

If a migration or source file must be retired, rename it in place with `.old` and document why in `Modules/Rating/docs/wiki/`.
